## Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

### 🚀 Who am I ?

I'm Louka DOZ, an IT engineer with a degree from ENSIIE in France and 3 years at Orange as an apprentice DevOps. 

I'm more specialized in development (C, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, Bash, ...) and automation (GitLab, RobotFramework, Cypress, ...). I have come across various projects since I started my studies from web apps to Big Data development, passing through game developement, DevOps, tests automation, Machine Learning, and more !

I have always loved to solve problems and to learn how things work.

### 🔭 What am I looking for ?

I'm looking for a job as a C, Python or Java developer in France or abroad.

I've also always had a passion for civil aviation, so I'm looking forward to one day working in this field.

### 👷‍♂️ What am I working on ?

I'm currently working on a horror video game where the player is confined to an enclosed space, pursued by monsters. The project isn't visible yet because I'm testing what I can do before taking going on this adventure, but I'd really like to make a video game that will be available on gaming platforms when the time comes.
