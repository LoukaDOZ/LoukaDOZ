## Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

### 🚀 Who am I ?

I'm Louka DOZ, an IT engineer with a degree from ENSIIE in France and 3 years at Orange as an apprentice DevOps. 

I'm more specialized in development (C, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, Bash, ...) and automation (GitLab, RobotFramework, Cypress, ...). I have come across various projects since I started my studies from web apps to Big Data development, passing through game developement, DevOps, tests automation, Machine Learning, and more !

I have always loved to solve problems and to learn how things work.

### 🔭 What am I looking for ?

I'm looking for a job as a C, Python or Java developer in France or abroad.

I've also always had a passion for civil aviation, so I'm looking forward to one day working in this field.

### 👷‍♂️ What am I working on ?

I was recently playing around with generative AI (GPT) and text-to-speech AI for a potential future assistant project, when I wanted to try using AI to replace the singers' voices in songs with my voice. I like this fun way of using AI. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything that suited me so I decided to try coding my own application: [AI-Voice-Cover](https://github.com/LoukaDOZ/AI-Voice-Cover). It's working now but the result isn't convincing, so I'm going to keep improving it.

### 🔬 What am I learning ?

A few months ago, I did a [Sort Renderer](https://github.com/LoukaDOZ/Sort-renderer) project in C and I really loved doing it and realised how much I love using the language. Following on from that, I want to learn C++, so I've started an OpenClassroom course and I solve LeetCode's day-to-day problems with it every day.
